          Swami Vivekananda Students Welfare Charitable Trust was established on June 10, 1996, by Kumari Basanti Manihar
		  with the aim of fostering the holistic development of underprivileged girl students. 
		  Shri Nandkishore Sharda served as the first President from its inception until his passing on January 24, 2003. 
		  Kumari Basanti Manihar then assumed the role of President, continuing in this capacity until her demise in May 2021. 
		  Since May 27, 2021, Kumari Madhubala Advani has been leading the Trust as its President.
		</p>
		<p>	
		  This trust, which is very special and unique in itself, is committed towards the holistic development of the girl child. 
		  Generally, all trusts accept the fulfillment of their duty by giving only financial assistance. 
		  The specialty of this trust is that apart from providing financial support, it is always available for guidance and help the girl students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shardaji was a great thinker, a sage, a visionary and a prophetic spiritual person.
		  His thinking was original, scientific and based on the characteristics and need of the present era. 
		  He firmly believed that education is a natural right of every person, especially the girl child. 
		  All beneficiary girls of the trust are members of the family of Divine Mother Maa Jagatjanani; 
		  financial assistance is their right, not a favor or charity
